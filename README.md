# MSG_NLP
This project was created while working with Mission Solutions Group and NLP techniques.

1. Use main.py to clean text data (parsedtext.json) and separate documents into clusters using k-means clustering

Use python notebook MSG.ipynb to create model for document similarity based on k-means clusters

Use BERT notebook to classify documents using SBERT (Sentence-BERT)

Use Doc2Vec for small corpuses (<5000 documents) to classify documents with adequate accuracy

Use Doc2Vec Annoy for large corpuses (>5000 documents) to classify documents
